\begin{abstract}
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has proven to be an extremely effective method for both aligning and matching recordings of songs to corresponding MIDI transcriptions.
The performance of DTW-based approaches in this domain is heavily effected by system design choices, such as the representation used for the audio and MIDI data and DTW's adjustable hyperparameters.
We propose a method for optimizing the design of DTW-based alignment and matching systems.
Our technique uses Bayesian optimization to tune system design and hyperparameters over a synthetically created dataset of audio and MIDI pairs.
We then perform an exhaustive search over DTW score normalization techniques in order to determine an optimal method for reporting a reliable alignment confidence score, which is necessary for matching tasks.
Using our approach, we are able to create a DTW-based system which is conceptually simple and highly accurate at both alignment and matching.
We also verified that our system achieves high performance in a large-scale qualitative evaluation of results on real-world data.
